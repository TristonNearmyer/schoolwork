<h2>Alaskan Husky</h2> 
<img src="images/husky.jpg" alt="Alaskan Husky" class="floatleft">
<p>Alaskan huskies are moderate in size, averaging 40 to 60 pounds (21 to 25 kg) for males, and 35 to 55 pounds (17 to 19 kg) for females. Some of them superficially resemble racing strains of the Siberian husky breed (which is part of the Alaskan husky genetic mix), but are usually smaller and leaner with a more pronounced tuck-up. 
Color and markings can vary; Alaskans may be of any possible canine color and any pattern of markings. Eyes may be of any color. Coats are almost always short to medium in length, never long. The shorter coat length is governed by the need for effective heat dissipation while racing. 
In very cold conditions, Alaskans often race in “dog coats” and/or belly protectors. Particularly in long distance races, these dogs often require “dog booties” to protect their feet from abrasion and cracking. The qualities of hardiness and climate resistance which are prevalent in breeds such as the Siberian husky and Canadian Inuit Dog are subordinated in the Alaskan husky to the overriding consideration of speed. On long-distance races, they require considerable care and attention on the trail at rest stops. <a href="care.html/#AlaskanHusky">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#AlaskanHusky">Adopt</a></p>


<section id="AlaskanMalamute"></section>
<h2 class="special">Alaskan Malamute</h2> 
<img src="images/malamute.jpg" alt="Alaskan Malamute" class="floatright">
<p>The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, “I work hard for a living!” But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with—playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids. <a href="care.html/#AlaskanMalamute">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#AlaskanMalamute">Adopt</a></p>

<h2 class="special">Alaskan Klee-Kai</h2> 
<img src="images/Klee-Kai.jpg" alt="Alaskan Klee-Kai" class="floatleft">
<p> Small, smart, and energetic, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed that looks like a smaller version of the Siberian Husky, and even the name “Klee Kai” comes from an Inuit term meaning “small dog.” While Alaskan Klee Kais may resemble larger Husky breeds, they have some key differences, especially when it comes to temperament, that distinguish it from its ancestor working class dogs of the north. This breed is more suited to the life of a companion, though the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Huskies and demands plenty of exercise. They also tend to be shy around strangers and are prone to expressing their emotions with whines and barks. An inexperienced owner would find it difficult to take on the challenge of caring for an Alaskan Klee Kai, but for an owner that keeps up with training and physical activity, this breed is sweet, loyal, and happy to shower loved ones with affection.<a href="care.html/#AlaskanKleeKai">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#AlaskanKleeKai">Adopt</a></p>

 <section id="AmericanEskimo"></section>
<h2 class="special">American Eskimo</h2> 
<img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="American Eskimo" class="floatright"> 
<p> The American Eskimo Dog comes in three sizes—standard, miniature, and toy—standing as tall as 19 inches at the shoulder or as short as 9 inches. Distinctive traits include a dense, sparkling white coat with a lion-like ruff around the chest and shoulders; a smiling face, with black nose, lips, and eye-rims that convey a keen, intelligent expression; and a plumed tail carried over the back. Some Eskies have markings with the delicious color name “biscuit cream.” They move with a bold and agile gait.
Eskies are social animals and can develop problem behaviors when neglected or undertrained—they insist on being part of family life. Among the most trainable of breeds, the clever, kid-friendly Eskie practically invented the phrase “eager to please." <a href="care.html/#AmericanEskimo">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#AmericanEskimo">adopt</a></p>

 <section id="SiberianHusky"></section>
<h2 class="special">Siberian Husky</h2> 
<img src="images/siberian-husky.jpg" alt="Siberian Husky" class="floatleft">
<p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute.
As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe’s innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.<a href="care.html/#SiberianHusky">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#SiberianHusky">adopt</a></p>

<section id="Samoyed"></section>
<h2 class="special">Samoyed</h2> 
<img src="images/dog-78787_1280.jpg" alt="Samoyed" class="floatright">
<p>Samoyeds, the smiling sledge dogs, were bred for hard work in the world’s coldest locales. In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common. The Sammy’s famous white coat is thick enough to protect against such brutal conditions.
Powerful, agile, tireless, impervious to cold—Sammies are drop-dead gorgeous but highly functional. Even their most delightful feature, a perpetual smile, has a practical function: The mouth’s upturned corners keep Sammies from drooling, preventing icicles from forming on the face.<a href="care.html/#Samoyed">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#Samoyed">adopt</a></p>

<section id="Greenland"></section>
<h2 class="special">Greenland</h2> 
<img src="images/Greenland.jpg" alt="Greenland" class="floatleft">
<p>The Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular, short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back. When it lies down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool-like fur, the outer layer of longer, coarser, water-repellent fur. 
A characteristic of most Greenland Dogs is the "úlo", a triangular shaped area on the shoulders. It is named after a common woman’s-knife from Greenland which is of the same shape. 
Males are significantly larger than females at between 58 and 68 cm (23–27 in) at the withers; females are between 51 and 61 cm (20–24 in).<a href="care.html/#Greenland">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#Greenland">adopt</a> </p>

<section id="SeppalaSiberianSledDog"></section>
<h2 class="special">Seppala Siberian Sled dog</h2> 
<img src="images/Sleddog.jpg" alt="Seppala Siberian Sled dog" class="floatright">
<p> Seppäläs of today differ markedly from many other Siberian Husky bloodlines in physical appearance, being in general less flashily marked, longer in leg and body length, and lighter in weight and physical build than most Siberian Husky show dog lines. Pure-strain Seppäläs have dense, smooth coats of medium length with an undercoat nearly as long as the guard hairs. Their ears are taller, set close together and strongly erect, the "stop" of the head less well-defined than that of Siberian Huskies. The tail is held high in a sickle curve over the back when alert, never "snapped" flat to the back or curling down the flank. 
Many Seppäläs are pure white or buff and white. Others are very dark, black, or charcoal grey with dark faces and white only on the feet and tail tip. There are many varied shades of grey, brownish grey, and blue-grey. “Sable” reds with black-tipped guard hairs and black noses occur, but the liver-nosed “copper” phase seen in other lines of Siberian Huskies is unknown in pure Seppäläs. Agouti "wild type" coloration and piebald spotting are common. <a href="care.html/#SeppalaSiberianSledDog">Care</a> <a href="adopt.html/#SeppalaSiberianSledDog">adopt</a></p>
