		<h1>Proper Care:</h1>
		<h3 id="cat">Domestic Shorthair:</h3>
		<p>There's not too much you have to provide an American Shorthair with besides love, attention, water and food--just be sure not to give too much of the latter, as this breed has a tendency to become overweight. This can put them at risk for diabetes and other health problems. American Shorthairs are prone to shedding, so make sure you brush your cat's coat a couple of times a week. These cats are great as either indoor or outdoor pets. You'll also have a long-term companion, as this sturdy, robust breed usually lives anywhere from 15 to 20 years. As always, check with your veterinarian with any questions you have about the health or care of your cat, and be sure to keep up with regular vaccinations.

		<h3 id="dog">Shephard Mix:</h3>
		<p>The German Shepherd can live outdoors in cool or temperate climates, but enjoys living indoors too. Frequent training or exercise sessions are essential for keeping its mind and body active, and because the German Shepherd sheds throughout the year, its coat should be brushed once or twice a week to encourage turnover as well as to minimize buildup in the home.
